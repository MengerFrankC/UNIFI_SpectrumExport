# UNIFI_SpectrumExport
Re-structuring of data exported from UNIFI for use in, e.g. MetFrag

A script intended to restructure data exported from UNIFI to make spectral information easier accessible for other software.

Example files:
A component list from UNIFI containing 4 target compounds and two samples (each sheet = onesample).
High collision energy spectra with and without errors in the data to test the script (one spectrum per sheet).
A folder 'MSMS' with examples of extracted spectrum information
